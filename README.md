The device, based on the STM32F407 microcontroller, receives USB signals via the HID Terminal to control digital inputs and outputs, generate analog voltages using the GP8403 DAC, and acquire analog data through the LTC1857 ADC. It also utilizes the BNO055 sensor to detect vibrations from the vehicle system and integrates an RGB LED to indicate emergency states.
